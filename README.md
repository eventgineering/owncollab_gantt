# owncollab_gantt
This is an gantt chart app for ownCloud. 
The app uses the editable JS gantt chart provided by dhtmlx. At this state the app requires a commercial license of dhtmxgantt.
Further updates will provide the open source version of dhtmlxgantt to run out of the box.

Setup instructions:
1. Place the app folder or clone the repository in your apps-folder of ownCloud.
2. Copy all elements of the dhtmlxgantt/codebase folder into the folder apps/owncollab_gantt/js/commercial (please create if not existent).
3. Activate owncollab_gantt in the ownCloud APP center.
